-> if there are too many files, let's say milions, having a list with all the files names might be dangerous. yield could be a solution but it would probably be stuck forever as new files would arrive and the list would be never ending. 
so, to handle this problem, we could set a folder limit of 30 minutes, that way only requests within that time window would be allocated there and, after those 30m, the number of fils in there would not change. in that situation,
yield could be a good thing. 

-> get_parquet/json_filenames could be generalized, could be something like get_filenames, where we just pass the filetype, the connection and the bucket to read from.
